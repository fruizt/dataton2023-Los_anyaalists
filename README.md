## Introduction

This repository contains a Python script for solving linear programming problems using the PuLP library. The solution utilizes multiple helper files for parsing input files, generating outputs, and handling various operations related to the linear programming problem.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have a `Windows/Linux/Mac` machine.
- You have installed Python 3.10.

## Installation

To install and run this project, you'll need to follow these steps:

### Setting Up a Virtual Environment

It's good practice to use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other projects or system-wide packages. To set up a virtual environment, run:

(Note: You may need to use `python` instead of `python3` depending on your system configuration.)

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

### Activate the virtual environment

On Windows:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

On Unix or MacOS:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Installing the Package

Once the virtual environment is activated, you can install the package and its dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install ./src/project
```

## Usage

To run the script, execute:

```bash
python3 ./src/solution.py
```

Make sure you are in the project's root directory before running the command.
